# LoopSync

A decentralized system for syncing and managing tokenized assets across accounts.

## Features
- Asset tokenization and tracking
- Atomic swaps between asset pairs
- Sync state verification
- Multi-signature authorization

## Usage
The contracts enable users to:
1. Register and tokenize assets
2. Track asset ownership and transfers
3. Perform atomic swaps between assets
4. Verify sync state across accounts

## Architecture
The system consists of three main contracts:
- Asset Registry: Handles asset registration and tokenization
- Sync Manager: Manages sync state and verification
- Swap Engine: Handles atomic swaps between assets
